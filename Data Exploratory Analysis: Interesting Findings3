#For the bigram, we also still observe that the most common words is also about timing, such as ‘last year’, ‘right now’ and also about places , such as ‘new york’, ‘high school’. Also if we notice that there are several bigram start with ‘last’ in differant ranking. Hence, when we design the text prediction, we can set a range e.g. 10-20 most common words and rank them which will result the suggestion options listed in this order ‘last year’, ‘last night’, ‘last week’. Let’s continue with the trigram.

# Create the dtm from the corpus: 
corpus_dtm_trigram <- TermDocumentMatrix(corpus, control = list(tokenize = trigram))
# Print out corpus_dtm_bigram data
corpus_dtm_trigram
## <<TermDocumentMatrix (terms: 301082, documents: 33365)>>
## Non-/sparse entries: 302841/10045298089
## Sparsity           : 100%
## Maximal term length: 108
## Weighting          : term frequency (tf)
freq3 <- getFreq(removeSparseTerms(corpus_dtm_trigram, 0.9999))
makeHistogramPlot(freq3, "10 Most Common Trigrams", "blue")

#For the trigram, we can see some congratulatory message that is related to occasional events such as ‘’mother’s day’, ‘new year’ which we expect will be a lot in conversational text like tweets. Also we can see expression of time, place and certain subject (e.g. president barrack obama) which usually appears a lot in news or tweets when the subject is an popular topics.

Alternatively, n-gram the statistics also can use term_stats function from the corpus library by specifying number of n-grams to be calculated (below are the results without using sparse and document matrix for trigram).

term_stats(corpus, ngrams = 3, types = TRUE)
